# Sunflower Farm

You are just a simple farmer, wanting to open up your very own sunflower farm. Growing sunflowers is easy right?

## Objective

At the start of each level, you are given just enough seeds to grow all the sunflowers you need.
If you plant the seeds in the soil and keep them well watered, eventually they will grow into beautiful sunflowers.
Your goal is to successfully grow and harvest all of the sunflowers.

## Rules

1. Sunflowers can only be planted in dirt.

2. Sunflower plants can only be harvested when they are flowering.

3. If a sunflower plant dies before harvest, you lose.

  a. If the water level bar above the plant disappears, the sunflower dries out and dies.
  
  b. If a bunny snacks on a sunflower for too long, the sunflower dies.
  
4. Bunnies will try to eat your sunflowers, but they are easily scared away if you get close to them.

5. A score is given for how fast you can grow and harvest all of your sunflowers.

6. You beat the level when you have harvested all of your sunflowers.
